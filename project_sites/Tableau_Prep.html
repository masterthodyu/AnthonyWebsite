            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This section showcases my interaction with Tableau Prep.
                Tableau Prep is a powerful tool for data preparation and cleaning.
                When this was first added into our production line in January 2025,
                we designed a couple of flows that we saw could've quickened production
                for our tableau projects drastically.
                Unfortunally I wasn't allowed to save any to show nor did most of the flows
                go into final production. But I did play with the tool and (before production got
                too busy for me to continue the challenge) made a flow design. 
                </p>

            <h2>Flow Design 1</h2>
            <p>Description of the first flow design. This flow was created to clean and prepare sales data for analysis.</p>

            <h2>Flow Design 2</h2>
            <p>Description of the second flow design. This flow was used to merge and transform customer data from multiple sources.</p>

            <h2>Flow Design 3</h2>
            <p>Description of the third flow design. This flow was designed to handle complex data transformations and aggregations for reporting purposes.</p>

            <h2>Example Challenge</h2>
            <p>This section highlights an example challenge I worked on using Tableau Prep. The challenge involved cleaning and preparing a large dataset for analysis, and the flow I designed helped streamline the process.</p>
            <img src="<!-- Image source here -->" alt="Example Challenge">

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>In the future, I plan to continue exploring Tableau Prep and leveraging its capabilities to tackle more complex data challenges. I aim to enhance my skills in data preparation and contribute to more efficient data workflows.</p>
