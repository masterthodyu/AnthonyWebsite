            <h2>Tableau Projects</h2>
            <p>While employed for 6 months as a data analyst, These were the projects that I worked on individually using Tableau and custom SQLs.
                I had to blur out the majority of everything since this is data I'm not allowed to share to the public.
                I can, however, explain the process and the steps I took to create these dashboards.</p>
            
            <h3>Dashboard with a Map</h3>
            <p>This dashboard, named "Dashboard with a map," demonstrates my ability to integrate a map into a Tableau dashboard. The map was generated using the longitude and latitude data provided in a database, which I am not allowed to detail. The map includes an action button that allows users to add the map to the dashboard.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Advanced Dashboard</h3>
            <p>This dashboard, named "Advanced Dashboard" (Procurement Data), displays a lot of information. 
                It includes navigation panels on the side that can redirect to other dashboards in the workbook, 
                a summary icon on the top left that users can hover over to see the summary of the workbook, 
                parameters in tan that can change the contents of each individual column, 
                filters for the columns, and other specifications that are blurred. 
                On the main page, selecting a cell pops up another table with more in-depth data 
                depending on the selected field.</p>
            <figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/Table_selction_drops_another_table.png" alt="Table selection drops another table">
                <figcaption>Demonstrates how filtering from a field on the dashboard displays another table
                    that goes more into depth
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The actions shown for this workbook display how I can allow fields on the main table to display data from another table based on selection. There are also redirect links for certain fields that redirect the user to a URL in the company's database.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Action menu containing redirect links and filtering</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>The column selections are built off of 5 parameters with 6 options, one of which is N/A as default to display nothing. The calculated field below displays how the columns will change depending on parameter selection:</p>
            <pre>
CASE [Select Column]
    WHEN "Option 1" THEN [Field 1]
    WHEN "Option 2" THEN [Field 2]
    WHEN "Option 3" THEN [Field 3]
    WHEN "Option 4" THEN [Field 4]
    WHEN "Option 5" THEN [Field 5]
    WHEN "N/A" THEN ""
END
            </pre>
            <p>The join for the table was structured similarly to this:</p>
            <pre>
FROM [Database].[Schema].[MainTable] MT  
LEFT JOIN [Database].[Schema].[DetailTable] DT  
    ON MT.[PrimaryKey] = DT.[ForeignKey]  
LEFT JOIN [Database].[Schema].[RelatedTable1] RT1  
    ON RT1.[JoinKey1] = DT.[JoinKey1]  
    AND RT1.[JoinKey2] = DT.[JoinKey2]  
LEFT JOIN [Database].[Schema].[RelatedTable2] RT2  
    ON RT2.[JoinKey3] = RT1.[JoinKey3]  
    AND RT2.[JoinKey4] = RT1.[JoinKey4]  
LEFT JOIN [Database].[Schema].[PeopleTable] PT  
    ON PT.[ID] = RT1.[RequestorID]  
LEFT JOIN [Database].[Schema].[HeaderTable] HT  
    ON RT1.[PONumber] = HT.[PONumber]  
            </pre>
            <p>These were all left joins because we wanted the first table to be the main source and keep everything joined afterward only relevant to the main table.</p>
            <p>There was a calculated field I had to convert into SQL because the calculated field had so many entries to scan that it would lag the interface. So I implemented it into the custom SQL so it would run smoother.</p>
            <p>The template for categorizing the content in this one field into groups:</p>
            <pre>
CASE  
    WHEN [Field1] LIKE '%123456%' THEN 'Group - Subcategory'  
    WHEN [Field2] LIKE '%Characters 
    related to item and subcategory%' THEN 'Group - Subcategory'  
    WHEN [Field2] LIKE '%Characters%' AND 
    [Field2] LIKE '%Subcategory%' THEN 'Group - Subcategory'  
    ELSE 'Default Value' -- Optional default case  
END
            </pre>
